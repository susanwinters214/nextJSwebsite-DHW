Home generators are a secondary power source as they provide power to certain home appliances or the entire home during an electrical outage.

Aside from providing power during an outage, it can be used in a workshop to power small tools or during camping/tailgating.


## Home Generator Maintenance

Irrespective of your choice and how often you use your home generator, it is possible not to experience a power outage for a few months and then years, so it is vital to keep them ready and still in service when the need arises. Hence, regular maintenance and service are required to prolong its lifespan and prevent untimely repairs.
