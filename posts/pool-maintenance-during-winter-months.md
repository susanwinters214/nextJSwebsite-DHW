Swimming pools add value to a property and make it more desirable and appealing while providing homeowners with other benefits such as relaxation, family time, fun pool parties, etc. To fully enjoy these benefits, homeowners need to keep their pool ready for use through all seasons, which will pay off for years, as fewer repairs and replacements will be required.

The cold winter takes its toll on everything, and swimming pools are not left out. Hence, it is crucial to know the dangers the cold can cause and move on to stay clear of them. 



## Dangers of Letting Your Pool Freeze

Water expands when it freezes and leaving your pool to freeze shortens the lifespan of the working pool and results in a long list of repairs from burst pipes and lines.  A frozen pool may damnage heaters, pumps and filters.  You should avoid your pool from freezing which can cause bacterial or algae infestation leading to health risks.

## 5 Tips To Keep Your Pool From Freezing

You can winterize, close your pool, or leave it open, and take precautions against the cold. 

1. All pool surfaces are cleaned and vacuumed as well as all pool equipment, the filter is back-washed, and all pipes are drained.
2. The pool water is tested to maintain balanced chemical levels (pH, total alkalinity, chlorine, etc.) to meet the recommended levels.
3. The recommended winter chemical kit(s) are added.
4. The water level is kept below the skimmer.
5. Winter kits, such as a pool cover, cover siphon, air pillow, etc., are used to avoid debris, leaves, precipitation, etc., from getting into the pool.

## Leaving Your Pool Open All Winter

Moving water is less likely to freeze than water standing still. So, to keep your pool through the cold winter, operate the pumps until the temperatures rise above freezing.

Leaving your pool open during winter requires you to keep:

 - The valves in your pool open so that water can move through the pipes.
 - The heater and filter pump working, or install a time clock with a freeze protection sensor that automatically turns your pumps on when the temperature drops and then turns your pump off when the weather warms up.
 - The pool covered to lock in heat.

Taking these steps will ensure that your swimming pool is ready to be opened in the spring.
